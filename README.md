# Errors While building
Will have to refactor currently build code (End of Day 3). Needed to have decided if to build a RESTful API or to have server side rendering. Whilst the app is currently built using REST I have decided to use Server Side Rendering.
**Reason**: I want to learn and experiment with some server side rendering features. It still doesn't feel right to be querying the database in a react component.
